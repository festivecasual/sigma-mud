#summary Help using Subversion with sigma-mud and Google Code

= Pruning =

You can run `svn stat` within the sigma-mud repository to discern what changes will be made upon commit, as well as any issues with the repository.  If you are noticing `?` entries within this listing for .pyc files, the repository needs to be cleaned up before committing.

These files are compiled Python code, and they should not be added to the repository.  To clean them automatically within Unix, it is possible to use the command:

`find ./ -name "*.pyc" -exec rm {} +`

= Repository Format =

As of Revision 49 (the first revision since the Google Code migration) the repository directory layout coincides with Google's recommended format.  Namely, there is a trunk/ directory that holds the main source.

No branches or other entries currently exist within the repository.
