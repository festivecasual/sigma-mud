      Things look a bit better here.  You see a waterfall ahead in the distance,
      but the developers will have to decide if you can get to it or not.  There is
      a tree here. There also seems to be a strange, apparently new path off to the 
      southwest.

      The penguin is waddling about, looking for attention from wherever
